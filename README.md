Brain age predictions from different FreeSurfer versions

We train brain age models on Freesurfer versions 5.3.0 and 7.4.1 processed grey matter metrics and predict on independent data within and between versions.

Trained models and code to train and predict is available.
I have also created synthetic data from all the original data, and included a jupyter notebook for educational purposes.

Note that the trained linear models (added last in the manuscript) are not included in the zip files together with the other trained models. The linear models were superior to the other models. If you want to use any to predict on your own data, then I'd suggest using these.
